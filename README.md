# CNN Image Classifier Project
## Outline of Repository:
- This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier using the PyTorch framework. 
- The classifier is designed to accurately classify images into predefined categories or classes.
- The project involves preprocessing image datasets, constructing the CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Project Overview
- The main objective of this project is to create an image classifier using a CNN architecture. The CNN is designed to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, enabling accurate classification into different classes or categories.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

 |---> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare your image dataset and organize it into training, validation, and testing sets.
2. Update the necessary configuration parameters in the project files, such as dataset paths, model hyperparameters, and training settings.
3. Run the training script to train the CNN model on your dataset:

 |---> python train.py

 |---> python evaluate.py

## Dataset
- Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- Include information about the classes, number of images per class, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

## Model Architecture
- Explain the architecture of the CNN used for classification.
- Describe the different layers (convolutional, pooling, fully connected) and their configurations.

## Training
- Provide details about the training process.
- Discuss the optimizer used, learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- Include any data augmentation techniques applied during training.

## Evaluation
- Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.
- Include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant metrics.

## Results
- Share the results of your trained model.
- Discuss its accuracy on the validation and test datasets.
- If applicable, provide examples of correctly and incorrectly classified images.
